ðŸ”— Live Demo: [Unit Management Dashboard](https://unit-management-dashboard.vercel.app/)

ðŸ“Š Overview:

The Unit Management Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to assist a rental unit management company in Stratford, Prince Edward Island, that previously relied on Excel spreadsheets. The goal was to build a proper database and create a connected dashboard interface to simplify and streamline their workflow.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal:

To replace the inefficient Excel-based system with:

* A relational database for storing customer, unit, rental, and payment data

* An interactive dashboard that connects to this database and provides clear, accessible insights for day-to-day operations

ðŸš€ Key Features:

* PostgreSQL Database: Structured and normalized to manage real-world business logic for units, customers, rentals, and payments.

* Automated Workflows: Triggers and queries to handle rental status, availability, and occupancy analytics.

* Dashboard Interface: Developed with React and Next.js for ease of use, including interactive charts and filters.

* Canned Reports: Pre-built views for monthly occupancy and revenue summaries to aid decision-making.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

* Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

* Backend: Node.js, Prisma ORM

* Database: PostgreSQL

* Deployment: Vercel

ðŸ“Œ Why This Matters:

This system drastically reduces manual errors, saves time, and makes rental and occupancy data more transparent. It brings modern tech to small-business operations, offering a scalable solution for future growth.
